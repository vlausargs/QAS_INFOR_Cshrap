CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
    File: SLApsSites.vb
    Summary: A new cryptographic algorithm will be used going forward.  However, the old algorithm w
        in the code, in order to be able to provide an easy, hands-free, automatic update for custom
        values will be automatically updated to the new algorithm as they are encountered.
    Details: The problem is caused by the use of PaddingMode Zeros.  We are now going to use Padding
        A prefix will be added to encrypted strings, to identify the padding mode being used, so tha
        which mode to use.  To update existing installations, when an encrypted value does not have
        it will be decrypted, encrypted using the new padding mode with a prefix added, and then rep
